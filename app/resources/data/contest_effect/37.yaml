    Works well if different in
    type than the one before.
  description: |
    The user's appeal points are double those normally given by the move if the move is a different contest type (not
    battle type) as the move used by the Pokémon before the user.  This calculation is done before considering bonuses,
    such as combos.

    This move will fail if the Pokémon before it did not move for some reason, such as being nervous or having its turn
    skipped.

    Affected by how well the
    appeal in front goes.
  description: |
    If the Pokémon who moved before had its appeal enhanced in some way (i.e. its appeal points were increased beyond
    the base appeal of the move because of a special move effect), this Pokémon's appeal is doubled.

    If the Pokémon in front performed a bad appeal, this Pokémon's appeal is set to zero.

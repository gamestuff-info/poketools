  description: &omega-ruby-alpha-sapphire.description |
    When this Pokémon enters battle or gains this ability, the weather becomes heavy rain.  Heavy rain has all the properties of []{move:rain-dance} and also causes damaging Fire moves to fail.

    Heavy rain ends when this Pokémon leaves battle or loses this ability, or when this ability is nullified.  The weather cannot otherwise be changed except by the effects of []{ability:delta-stream} and []{ability:desolate-land}.

    []{ability:air-lock} and []{ability:cloud-nine} will prevent the effects of heavy rain, including allowing Fire moves to work, but will not allow the weather to be changed.

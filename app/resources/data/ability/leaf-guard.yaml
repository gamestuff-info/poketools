    This Pokémon cannot be given a [major status ailment]{mechanic:major-status-ailment} during [strong sunlight]{mechanic:strong-sunlight}.

    This ability does not heal prior status ailments.  []{move:rest} will fail altogether with this ability in effect.  []{move:yawn} will immediately fail if used on this Pokémon during strong sunlight, and an already-used Yawn will fail if the weather turns to strong sunlight in the meantime.

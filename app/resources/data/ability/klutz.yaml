  description: &black-white.description |
    In battle, this Pokémon cannot use its held item, nor will the item have any passive effect on the battle, positive or negative.  This Pokémon also cannot use []{move:fling}.

    The [Speed]{mechanic:speed} cut from the []{item:iron-ball} and the effort items (the []{item:macho-brace}, []{item:power-weight}, []{item:power-bracer}, []{item:power-belt}, []{item:power-lens}, []{item:power-band}, and []{item:power-anklet}) is unaffected.  Items that do not directly affect the battle, such as the []{item:exp-share}, the []{item:amulet-coin}, or the []{item:soothe-bell}, work as usual.  All held items work as usual out of battle.

    Other moves that use the held item, such as []{move:natural-gift} and []{move:switcheroo}, work as usual.

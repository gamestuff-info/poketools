  description: &omega-ruby-alpha-sapphire.description |
    When this Pokémon enters battle or gains this ability, the weather becomes extremely harsh sunlight.  Extremely harsh sunlight has all the properties of []{move:sunny-day} and also causes damaging Water moves to fail.

    Extremely harsh sunlight ends when this Pokémon leaves battle or loses this ability, or when this ability is nullified.  The weather cannot otherwise be changed except by the effects of []{ability:delta-stream} and []{ability:primordial-sea}.

    []{ability:air-lock} and []{ability:cloud-nine} will prevent the effects of extremely harsh sunlight, including allowing Water moves to work, but will not allow the weather to be changed.

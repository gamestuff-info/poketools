    The [weather]{mechanic:weather} changes to a [sandstorm]{mechanic:sandstorm} when this Pokémon enters battle and does not end unless cancelled by another weather condition.

    If multiple Pokémon with this ability, []{ability:drizzle}, or []{ability:drought} are sent out at the same time, the abilities will activate in order of [Speed]{mechanic:speed}.  Each ability's weather will cancel the previous weather, and only the weather summoned by the slowest of the Pokémon will stay.

    Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, the wild encounter rate is halved in a sandstorm.

  description: &ruby-sapphire.description |
    Whenever a move makes contact with this Pokémon, the move's user has a 30% chance of being [paralyzed]{mechanic:paralysis}, [poisoned]{mechanic:poison}, or put to [sleep]{mechanic:sleep}, chosen at random.

    Nothing is done to compensate if the move's user is immune to one of these ailments; there is simply a lower chance that the move's user will be affected.

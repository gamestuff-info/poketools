    Every second turn on which this Pokémon should attempt to use a move, it will instead do nothing ("loaf around").

    Loafing around interrupts moves that take multiple turns the same way [paralysis]{mechanic:paralysis}, [flinching]{mechanic:flinching}, etc do.  Most such moves, for example []{move:bide} or []{move:rollout}, are simply cut off upon loafing around.  Attacks with a recharge turn, such as []{move:hyper-beam}, do not have to recharge; attacks with a preparation turn, such as []{move:fly}, do not end up being used.  Moves that are forced over multiple turns and keep going through failure, such as []{move:outrage}, []{move:uproar}, or any move forced by []{move:encore}, keep going as usual.

    If this Pokémon is [confused]{mechanic:confusion}, its confusion is not checked when loafing around; the Pokémon cannot hurt itself, and its confusion does not end or come closer to ending.

    If this Pokémon attempts to move but fails, e.g. because of [paralysis]{mechanic:paralysis}, it still counts as having moved and will loaf around the next turn.  If it does not attempt to move, e.g. because it is [asleep]{mechanic:sleep} or [frozen]{mechanic:freezing}, whatever it would have done will be postponed until its next attempt; that is, it will either loaf around or move as usual, depending on what it last did.

    This ability can be changed with []{move:role-play} or traded away with []{move:skill-swap}.

    If this Pokémon attempts to move but fails, e.g. because of [paralysis]{mechanic:paralysis} or []{move:gravity}, it still counts as having moved and will loaf around the next turn.  If it does not attempt to move, e.g. because it is [asleep]{mechanic:sleep} or [frozen]{mechanic:freezing}, whatever it would have done will be postponed until its next attempt; that is, it will either loaf around or move as usual, depending on what it last did.

    This ability cannot be changed with []{move:worry-seed}, but it can be disabled with []{move:gastro-acid}, changed with []{move:role-play}, or traded away with []{move:skill-swap}.

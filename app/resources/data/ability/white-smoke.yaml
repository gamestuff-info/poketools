    This Pokémon cannot have its stats [lowered]{mechanic:stat-modifier} by other Pokémon.

    This ability does not prevent any stat losses other than [stat modifiers]{mechanic:stat-modifiers}, such as the [Speed]{mechanic:speed} cut from [paralysis]{mechanic:paralysis}; nor self-inflicted stat drops, such as the [Special Attack]{mechanic:special-attack} drop from []{move:overheat}; nor opponent-triggered stat boosts, such as the [Attack]{mechanic:attack} boost from []{move:swagger}.

    This ability functions identically to []{ability:clear-body} in battle.

    This Pokémon is immune to []{type:fire}-type moves.  Once this Pokémon has been hit by a Fire move, its own Fire moves will inflict 1.5× as much damage until it leaves battle.

    This ability has no effect while the Pokémon is [frozen]{mechanic:freezing}.  The Fire damage bonus is retained even if the Pokémon is frozen and thawed or the ability is lost or disabled.  Fire moves will ignore this Pokémon's []{move:substitute}.  This ability takes effect even on non-damaging moves, i.e. []{move:will-o-wisp}.

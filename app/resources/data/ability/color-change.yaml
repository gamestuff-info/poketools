  description: &black-white.description |
    Whenever this Pokémon takes damage from a move, the Pokémon's type changes to match the move.

    If the Pokémon has two types, both are overridden.  The Pokémon must directly take damage; for example, moves blocked by a []{move:substitute} will not trigger this ability, nor will moves that deal damage indirectly, such as []{move:spikes}.

    This ability takes effect on only the last hit of a multiple-hit attack.

    In Pokémon Colosseum and XD: Gale of Darkness, this ability does not take effect on Shadow-type moves.

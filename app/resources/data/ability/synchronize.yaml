    Whenever this Pokémon is [burned]{mechanic:burn}, [paralyzed]{mechanic:paralysis}, or [poisoned]{mechanic:poison}, the Pokémon who gave this Pokémon that ailment is also given the ailment.

    This ability passes back bad poison when this Pokémon is badly poisoned.  This ability cannot pass on a status ailment that the Pokémon did not directly receive from another Pokémon, such as the poison from []{move:toxic-spikes} or the burn from a []{item:flame-orb}.

    Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, wild Pokémon have a 50% chance of having the lead Pokémon's nature, and a 50% chance of being given a random nature as usual, including the lead Pokémon's nature.  This does not work on Pokémon received outside of battle or roaming legendaries.

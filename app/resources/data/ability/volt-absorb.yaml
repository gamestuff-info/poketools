  description: &diamond-pearl.description |
    Whenever an []{type:electric}-type move hits this Pokémon, it heals for 1/4 of its maximum [HP]{mechanic:hp}, negating any other effect on it.

    This ability will not take effect if this Pokémon is []{type:ground}-type and thus immune to Electric moves.  Electric moves will ignore this Pokémon's []{move:substitute}.

    This effect includes non-damaging moves, i.e. []{move:thunder-wave}.

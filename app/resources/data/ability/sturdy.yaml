  description: &black-white.description |
    When this Pokémon is at full [HP]{mechanic:hp}, any hit that would knock it out will instead leave it with 1 HP.  Regardless of its current HP, it is also immune to the one-hit KO moves: []{move:fissure}, []{move:guillotine}, []{move:horn-drill}, and []{move:sheer-cold}.

    If this Pokémon is holding a []{item:focus-sash}, this ability takes precedence and the item will not be consumed.

    It cannot be knocked
    out with one hit.

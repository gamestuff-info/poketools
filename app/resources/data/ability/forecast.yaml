    During [rain]{mechanic:rain}, [strong sunlight]{mechanic:strong-sunlight}, or [hail]{mechanic:hail}, this Pokémon's type changes to []{type:water}, []{type:fire}, or []{type:ice}, respectively, and its form changes to match.

If this ability is lost or disabled, this Pokémon cannot change its current type and form until it regains its ability.

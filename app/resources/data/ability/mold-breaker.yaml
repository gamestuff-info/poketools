  short_description: &diamond-pearl.short_description 'Bypasses targets'' abilities if they could hinder or prevent a move.'
  description: |
    This Pokémon's moves completely ignore abilities that could hinder or prevent their effect on the target.

    For example, this Pokémon's moves ignore abilities that would fully negate them, such as []{ability:water-absorb}; abilities that would prevent any of their effects, such as []{ability:clear-body}, []{ability:shell-armor}, or []{ability:sticky-hold}; and abilities that grant any general protective benefit, such as []{ability:simple}, []{ability:snow-cloak}, or []{ability:thick-fat}.  If an ability could either hinder or help this Pokémon's moves, e.g. []{ability:dry-skin} or []{ability:unaware}, the ability is ignored either way.

    Abilities that do not fit this description, even if they could hinder moves in some other way, are not affected.  For example, []{ability:liquid-ooze} and []{ability:shadow-tag} can only hinder a move's effect on the user.  This ablity cannot ignore type or form changes granted by abilities, for example []{ability:color-change} or []{ability:forecast}; nor effects that were caused by abilities but are no longer tied to an ability, such as the rain from []{ability:drizzle}.  This ability cannot ignore []{ability:multitype} at all.

    An ability ignored by this ability is only nullified while the move is being used.  For example, this Pokémon's moves can [paralyze]{mechanic:paralysis} a Pokémon with []{ability:limber}, but Limber will activate and heal the paralysis immediately thereafter, and this Pokémon's []{move:spikes} are not affected by this ability after they have been placed.

    When this Pokémon enters battle, all participating trainers are notified that it has this ability.

    Abilities that do not fit this description, even if they could hinder moves in some other way, are not affected.  For example, []{ability:cursed-body} only affects potential future uses of the move, while []{ability:liquid-ooze} and []{ability:shadow-tag} can only hinder a move's effect on the user.

    This ability functions identically to []{ability:teravolt} and []{ability:turboblaze}.

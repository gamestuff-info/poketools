    This Pokémon is immune to moves flagged as being sound-based.

    []{move:heal-bell} is unaffected.  []{move:uproar} still prevents this Pokémon from [sleeping]{mechanic:sleep}.  This Pokémon can still receive a Perish Song counter through []{move:baton-pass}, and will retain a Perish Song counter if it acquires this ability after Perish Song is used.

    []{move:howl}, []{move:roar-of-time}, []{move:sonic-boom}, and []{move:yawn} are not flagged as sound-based.

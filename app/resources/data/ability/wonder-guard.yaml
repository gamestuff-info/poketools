  description: &black-white.description |
    This Pokémon is immune to damaging moves that are not [super effective]{mechanic:super-effective} against it.

    Moves that inflict fixed damage, such as []{move:night-shade} or []{move:seismic-toss}, are considered super effective if their types are.  Damage not directly dealt by moves, such as damage from [weather]{mechanic:weather}, a [status ailment]{mechanic:status-ailment}, or []{move:spikes}, is not prevented.

    This ability cannot be copied with []{move:role-play} or traded away with []{move:skill-swap}, but it can be copied with []{ability:trace}, disabled with []{move:gastro-acid}, or changed with []{move:worry-seed}.  This Pokémon can still use Role Play itself to lose this ability, but not Skill Swap.

    If this Pokémon has a []{move:substitute}, this ability will block moves as usual and any moves not blocked will react to the Substitute as usual.

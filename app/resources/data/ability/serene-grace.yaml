    This Pok√©mon's moves have twice their usual effect chance.

    An effect chance is a move's chance to inflict a [status ailment]{mechanic:status-ailment}, cause a [stat change]{mechanic:stat-modifier}, or make the target [flinch]{mechanic:flinching} in addition to the move's main effect.  For example, []{move:flamethrower}'s chance of [burning]{mechanic:burn} the target is doubled, but []{move:protect}'s chance of success and []{move:air-cutter}'s increased [critical hit]{mechanic:critical-hit} rate are unaffected.

    []{move:secret-power} is unaffected.

    This Pokémon has a chance of picking up []{item:honey} after each battle.  This chance starts at 5% and rises another 5% after every tenth level: 5% from level 1–10, 10% from 11–20, and so on, up to 50% from 91–100.

    This ability is checked after the battle ends, at which point any temporary ability changes have worn off.

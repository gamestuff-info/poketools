    If multiple Pokémon with this ability, []{ability:drizzle}, []{ability:drought}, or []{ability:sand-stream} are sent out at the same time, the abilities will activate in order of [Speed]{mechanic:speed}, respecting []{move:trick-room}.  Each ability's weather will cancel the previous weather, and only the weather summoned by the slowest of the Pokémon will stay.

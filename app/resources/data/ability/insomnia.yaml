  description: &ruby-sapphire.description |
    This Pokémon cannot be [asleep]{mechanic:sleep}.

    This causes []{move:rest} to fail altogether.  If a Pokémon is asleep and acquires this ability, it will immediately wake up; this includes when regaining a lost ability upon leaving battle.

    This ability functions identically to []{ability:vital-spirit} in battle.

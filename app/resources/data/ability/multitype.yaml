  description: &diamond-pearl.description |
    If this Pokémon is holding an elemental Plate, its type and form change to match the Plate.

    This Pokémon's held item, whether or not it is a Plate, cannot be taken by []{move:covet} or []{move:thief}, nor removed by []{move:knock-off}, nor traded by []{move:switcheroo} or []{move:trick}.  Covet, Thief, and Knock Off still inflict damage against this Pokémon.  Unlike with []{ability:sticky-hold}, this Pokémon cannot use []{move:fling}, Switcheroo, or Trick to lose its item itself, nor gain an item through Switcheroo or Trick if it does not have one.

    This ability has no effect for any Pokémon other than []{pokemon:arceus}.  This ability cannot be traded with []{move:skill-swap}, nor copied with []{move:role-play} or []{ability:trace}, nor disabled with []{move:gastro-acid}, nor changed with []{move:worry-seed}.  This Pokémon cannot use Skill Swap or Role Play to lose its ability itself.  []{ability:mold-breaker} cannot ignore this ability.

    If a Pokémon [Transforms]{move:transform} into an Arceus with this ability, it will Transform into Arceus's default, []{type:normal}-type form.  If the Transforming Pokémon is holding a Plate, this ability will then activate and change the Pokémon into the corresponding form.

  description: &black-white.description |
    This Pokémon's moves with extra effects have 1.3× their power, but lose their extra effects.

    An effect chance is a move's chance to inflict a status ailment, cause a stat change, or make the target flinch in addition to the move's main effect. For example, []{move:thunder-shock}'s paralysis is an extra effect, but []{move:thunder-wave}'s is not, nor are []{move:knock-off}'s item removal and []{move:air-cutter}'s increased [critical hit]{mechanic:critical-hit} rate.

    Moves that lower the user's stats are unaffected.

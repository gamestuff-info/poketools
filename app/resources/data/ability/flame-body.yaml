    Whenever a move makes contact with this Pokémon, the move's user has a 30% chance of being [burned]{mechanic:burn}.

    Overworld: If any Pokémon in the party has this ability, each egg in the party has its [hatch counter]{mechanic:hatch-counter} decreased by 2 (rather than 1) each [step cycle]{mechanic:step-cycle}, making eggs hatch roughly twice as quickly.  This effect does not stack if multiple Pokémon have this ability or []{ability:magma-armor}.

  short_description: &black-white.short_description 'Redirects single-target []{type:electric} moves to this Pokémon where possible.  Absorbs Electric moves, raising [Special Attack]{mechanic:special-attack} one [stage]{mechanic:stat-modifier}.'
  description: &black-white.description |
    All other Pokémon's single-target []{type:electric}-type moves are redirected to this Pokémon if it is an eligible target.  Other Pokémon's Electric moves raise this Pokémon's [Special Attack]{mechanic:special-attack} one [stage]{mechanic:stat-modifier}, negating any other effect on it, and cannot miss it.

    If the move's intended target also has this ability, the move is not redirected.  When multiple Pokémon with this ability are possible targets for redirection, the move is redirected to the one with the highest [Speed]{mechanic:speed} stat, or, in the case of a tie, to a random tied Pokémon.  []{move:follow-me} takes precedence over this ability.

    If the Pokémon is a []{type:ground}-type and thus immune to Electric moves, its immunity prevents the Special Attack boost.

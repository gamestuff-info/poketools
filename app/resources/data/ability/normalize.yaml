  description: &diamond-pearl.description |
    This Pokémon's moves all act as if they were []{type:normal}-type.

    Moves that inflict [typeless damage]{mechanic:typeless-damage} do so as usual.  Moves of variable type, such as []{move:hidden-power}, are affected.  They otherwise work as usual, however; []{move:weather-ball}, for example, is always forced to be Normal, but it still has doubled power and looks different during [weather]{mechanic:weather}.

    As []{move:thunder-wave} is prevented by immunities, unlike most non-damaging moves, it does not affect []{type:ghost}-type Pokémon under the effect of this ability.

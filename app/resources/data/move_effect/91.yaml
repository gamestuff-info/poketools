  short_description: 'Forces the target to repeat its last used move every turn for 2 to 6 turns.'
  description: |
    The next 4â€“8 times (selected at random) the target attempts to move, it is forced to repeat its last used move.  If the selected move allows the trainer to select a target, an opponent will be selected at random each turn.  If the target is prevented from using the selected move by some other effect, []{move:struggle} will be used instead.  This effect ends if the selected move runs out of [PP]{mechanic:pp}.

    If the target hasn't used a move since entering the [field]{mechanic:field}, if it tried to use a move this turn and [failed]{mechanic:failed}, if it does not know the selected move, or if the selected move has 0 [PP]{mechanic:pp} remaining, this move will fail.  If the target's last used move was []{move:encore}, []{move:mimic}, []{move:mirror-move}, []{move:sketch}, []{move:struggle}, or []{move:transform}, this move will fail.

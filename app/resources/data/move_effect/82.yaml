    Locks the user into this move, inflicting [regular damage]{mechanic:regular-damage}.  Every time the user is hit
    after it uses this move but before its next action, its [Attack]{mechanic:attack} raises by one
    [stage]{mechanic:stage}.

    Due to a bug, if this move misses, its [accuracy]{mechanic:accuracy} drops to 1/256 as long as the user is still
    locked in.

    Raises the user's [Defense]{mechanic:defense} and [Special Defense]{mechanic:special-defense} by one [stage]{mechanic:stage} each.  Stores energy for use with []{move:spit-up} and []{move:swallow}.  Up to three levels of energy can be stored, and all are lost if the user leaves the [field]{mechanic:field}.  Energy is still stored even if the stat boosts cannot be applied.

    If the user uses []{move:baton-pass}, the stat boosts are passed as normal, but the stored energy is not.

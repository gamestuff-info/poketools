  description: |
    Inflicts [typeless]{mechanic:typeless} [regular damage]{mechanic:regular-damage} at the end of the third turn, starting with this one.  This move cannot score a [critical hit]{mechanic:critical-hit}.  If the target [switches out]{mechanic:switches-out}, its replacement will be hit instead.  Damage is calculated at the time this move is used; [stat changes]{mechanic:stat-changes} and [switching out]{mechanic:switching-out} during the delay won't change the damage inflicted.  No move with this effect can be used against the same target again until after the end of the third turn.

    If the target is protected by []{move:protect} or []{move:detect} on the turn this move is used, this move will [fail]{mechanic:fail}.  However, the damage on the third turn will break through protection.

    Because the damage is applied at the end of the turn, it ignores []{move:endure}.

    This move cannot be copied by []{move:mirror-move}.

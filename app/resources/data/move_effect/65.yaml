  short_description: 'Reduces damage from special attacks by half.'
  description: |
    Erects a barrier around the user's side of the field that reduces damage from [special]{mechanic:special} attacks by half for five turns.  [Critical hit]{mechanic:critical-hit}s are not affected by the barrier.

    Becuase this is implemented by temporarily doubling the user's Special stat when hit with a Special attack,
    undesired behavior may occur for Pok√©mon with Special stats above 255 as the stat wraps around.

    Every Pokémon is given a counter that starts at 3 and decreases by 1 at the end of every turn, including this one.  When a Pokémon's counter reaches zero, that Pokémon [faint]{mechanic:faint}s.  A Pokémon that leaves the [field]{mechanic:field} will lose its counter; its replacement does not inherit the effect, and other Pokémon's counters remain.

    This effect is passed on by []{move:baton-pass}.

    User falls to [sleep]{mechanic:sleep} and immediately regains all its [HP]{mechanic:hp}.  If the user has another [major status effect]{mechanic:major-status-effect}, [sleep]{mechanic:sleep} will replace it.  The user will always wake up after two turns, or one turn with []{ability:early-bird}.

    This move [fail]{mechanic:fail}s if the Pokémon cannot fall asleep due to []{move:uproar}, []{ability:insomnia}, or []{ability:vital-spirit}.  It also fails if the Pokémon is at full health or is already asleep.

    Uses the last move targeted at the user by a Pokémon still on the [field]{mechanic:field}.  A move counts as targeting the user even if it hit multiple Pokémon, as long as the user was one of them; however, moves targeting the [field]{mechanic:field} itself do not count.  If the user has not been targeted by an appropriate move since entering the [field]{mechanic:field}, or if no Pokémon that targeted the user remains on the [field]{mechanic:field}, this move will [fail]{mechanic:fail}.

    Moves that [failed]{mechanic:fail}, [missed]{mechanic:miss}, had [no effect]{mechanic:no-effect}, or were [blocked]{mechanic:block} are still copied.

    This move cannot be selected by []{move:metronome}.

    Assist moves, time-delayed moves, “meta” moves that operate on other moves/Pokémon, and some other special moves cannot be copied and are ignored; if the last move to hit the user was such a move, the previous move will be used instead.  The full list of eligible moves is:

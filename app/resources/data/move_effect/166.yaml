  description: |
    Prevents the target from attempting to use the same move twice in a row.  When the target leaves the [field]{mechanic:field}, this effect ends.

    If the target is forced to attempt a repeated move due to []{item:choice-band}, []{move:disable}, []{move:encore}, []{move:taunt}, only having [PP]{mechanic:pp} remaining for one move, or any other effect, the target will use []{move:struggle} instead.  The target is then free to use the forced move next turn, as it didn't use that move this turn.

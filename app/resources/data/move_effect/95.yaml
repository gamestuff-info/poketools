  short_description: 'Ensures that the user''s next move will hit the target.'
  description: |
    If the user targets the same target again before the end of the next turn, the move it uses is guaranteed to hit.  This move itself also ignores [accuracy]{mechanic:accuracy} and [evasion]{mechanic:evasion} modifiers.

    One-hit KO moves are also guaranteed to hit, as long as the user is equal or higher level than the target.  This effect also allows the user to hit Pok√©mon that are off the field due to moves such as []{move:dig} or []{move:fly}.

    If the target uses []{move:detect} or []{move:protect} while under the effect of this move, the user is not guaranteed to hit, but has a (100 - accuracy)% chance to break through the protection.

    This effect is passed on by []{move:baton-pass}.

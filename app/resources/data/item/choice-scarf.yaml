    Held: Increases the holder's [Speed]{mechanic:speed} by 50%, but restricts it to the first move it uses until
    it leaves battle or loses this item.  If this item is swapped for another Choice item via []{move:trick} or
    []{move:switcheroo}, the holder's restriction is still lifted, but it will again be restricted to the next move
    it uses.

    Held
    :   The holder will go last within its move's [priority]{mechanic:priority} bracket, regardless of [Speed]{mechanic:speed},
    similar to the []{item:lagging-tail}.  If multiple Pokémon within the same priority bracket are subject to this
    effect, the slower Pokémon will go first.  The holder will move after Pokémon with []{ability:stall}.  If the holder
    has Stall, Stall is ignored.  This item ignores []{move:trick-room}.

    This is most effectivley used with techniques that move held items around, such as []{move:fling}, []{move:trick}, or
    []{move:switcheroo}.

    Breeding
    :   A []{pokemon:snorlax} holding this item will beget a []{pokemon:munchlax} egg.

    Used by a trainer in battle
    :   Attempts to [catch]{mechanic:catch} a wild Pokémon.  If used in a trainer battle, nothing happens and the ball is lost.

    If the trainer's Pokémon and wild Pokémon are of the same species and same gender, the wild Pokémon's catch rate is 8× normal.
    This behavior is because of a [bug](https://github.com/pret/pokegold/blob/a7e3a999ff21ecac0bfbe7f091f9ff901075a323/items/item_effects.asm#L829).
